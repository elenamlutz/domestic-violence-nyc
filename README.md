# Domestic Violence is Getting Worse in New York City
On Jan. 6, 2020, the New York City Police Department released crime statistics showing that overall crime in New York City hit a record low in 2019. There was an increase, though, in the number of murders, rising to 318 last year, up from 295 in 2018. Officials attributed the increase in part to the reclassification of some crimes â€” but also to an increase in deaths associated with domestic violence.

Since 2017, following the allegations against Harvey Weinstein, the #MeToo movement has given women who have suffered from sexual assault a platform to come forward and accuse perpetrators, all while enforcing the fight against gender-based violence. But in New York City, sexual offense crimes against women in each city borough reached a seven-year high in 2018.

The New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services [collects](https://www.criminaljustice.ny.gov/crimnet/ojsa/domestic-violence-data.html) city information on victims of domestic violence provided by the NYPD. Data on domestic violence resulting in sex offense crimes includes offenses of rape, statutory rape, sodomy, incest and sexual abuse. The number of female victims reported by NYPD under this category had a 75 percent increase from 2012-2018, according to the latest data available.
